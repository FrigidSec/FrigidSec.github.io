What do you see? A bunch of\n        teams competing to find a treasure? If you think so, you are right. Let\n        me put \"CTF\" into simpler terms. CTF stands for Capture The Flag. It's a\n        treasure hunt, and it happens inside a machine. You race against other\n        teams to find the treasure. What treasure are you looking for? It's\n        called a flag. A flag is a variable that defines the current state of\n        the system or holds an intermediary value. Find this flag first, and you\n        win the game.\n      </p>\n      <span className=\"image main\">\n        <img src={pic} alt=\"\" height=\"400\" />\n      </span>\n    </article>\n    <br />\n    <Link to=\"/\">Go back to the homepage</Link>\n    <br />\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default cyberera\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"static/pic02-aaa10269fc697db31c3b8310b9036a33.webp\";"],"sourceRoot":""}
