A few are as follows:"),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Physical challenges: In a physical challenge, the challenger will give you a key and lock you in a closed space. This key can be any storage device. The challenge is to examine the key, find the flag, and break out of the space."),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Website challenges: A webpage or a set of pages are given to you for finding a flag. The challenge might involve exploring the page and crafting a file that makes the website output the flag."),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Network challenges: A sample network is given, and it is under attack. To save the network, you need to find the flag and perform the mentioned tasks with it."),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Reverse engineering challenges: In a reverse engineering challenge, you have to scour through the code of an executable file to find the flag. For establishing a better understanding of the challenge, you may need to run the executable and understand its behavior."),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Steganography challenges: In this case, the flag is hidden in an image or some other similar media.

This process may be repeated again and again to increase complexity. You have to decrypt each layer one-by-one to reach the flag."),l.a.createElement("li",{style:{marginBottom:"40px"}}," ","Forensic analysis challenges: You are provided with logs and memory dumps of a compromised machine or a machine that was used to attack another computer.
